# Chat Room Server

A very basic socket based chat room server where every message is broadcasted to every connected client.
Clients can use different commands, which are:
  - "<cn> name": Changes the username
  - "<exit>": Exits the chat room

Todo:
  - Create a private chat room between 2 clients to support private messaging.
  - Encrypt the messages.
